## About Me 🌱
I am a Master of Business Analytics student learning how advanced analytics can make data-driven business decisions. I am currently studying Forecasting and Time Series Prediction and Machine Learning. I am passionate about retail/e-commerce and how digital tools can drive value and improve customer experiences. I have a background in business, consulting, and ecommerce, and a desire to learn more about data science. When I am not creating models or debugging code, I am baking away, creating portraits, finding ways to support the AAPI community, and picking up new skills like Procreate.
